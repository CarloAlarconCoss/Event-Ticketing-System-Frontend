# Event-Ticketing-System

**Preparation guidelines**
 
## Introduction
In this document, you will find an introduction to help you understand the process and rules of the development test. It also includes some tips and resources to help you get ready. Make sure to go through the links and materials carefully so you are well-prepared for the tasks ahead.
 
## What is the Dev-test?
Welcome to the Jalasoft DevTest event. The DevTest is an event where you are going to be 
able to show your technical, soft and process skills by working individually to solve the given 
problem for the test, based on a couple of requirements, where you are going to be able to 
choose the ones you think can provide more value to the product and can be finished given the 
time frame of the event. The skills we will mainly observe are:

* Research.
* Analysis.
* Programming language knowledge and experience.
* Coding best practices.
* Autonomy.
* Time management.
* Resource management.
 
## How will the Dev-test be conducted?
* Event day
  * The event will last 4 hours.
  * The challenges to beat will be delivered to you on the same day of the event.
  * You will have 3 hours to complete the challenges, so make sure to use it wisely.
  * There will be a break time planned to help you refresh your mind.
  * The remaining 30 minutes will be used to give some time to all participants to prepare a demo, the time for a demo presentation is around 10 mins each.
* Additionally, some Jalasoft engineers will be on the call to help you with any technical issues or doubts. By the end of the test, all your code must be pushed into your Github assigned repository and you’ll be asked to demo your work.
* You can choose between just doing frontend (in this case you will be provided with an API to consume), just backend or both. Doing both is a plus.
 
## What are the Requirements for the Dev-test?
* Find a quiet and peaceful place where you can stay during the event without interruptions if possible.
* It’s highly recommended that you have a stable and dedicated internet connection.
* You ‘ll need a decent internet bandwidth because you’ll be requested to share your camera and screen all the time.
* You should have your microphone properly configured.
* You should also have a webcam properly connected to your PC.
* You can use an OS according to the development stack of your preference.
* Software Requirements
  * Communication tools
    * Microsoft Teams
  * Source Code Technology
  * Git
  * Github account (See configuration instructions section below)
  * Postman or any rest client you are familiarized with

We strongly recommend having a cleanup and functional development environment, below some recommendations according to the respective chosen technology for each dev stack.
* Some IDE Tools (suggested)
  * Visual Studio Community Edition
  * Visual Studio Code
  * PyCharm Community Edition

Feel free to use any other IDE of your preference.

Please, be sure to prepare and install everything you need for developing, so you have everything up and running before the DevTest (e.g IDEs, npm, NodeJS, python, databases, etc.) because everything is calculated to be completed in the given time.
 
## Recommendations

* Punctuality is very important for us, so please be at least 10 minutes before the start time of the event. Please notice the time we have is very tiring for all and you can fall into disadvantages if you get late.
* During the test, plan your tasks carefully to optimize your time. We recommend completing as many requirements as you can.
* Make sure to integrate your commits very often to avoid inconvenience for the final demo.
* English is key to success so make sure to use it all the time if possible (variables naming, commit comments, demo, etc.) also all the communication with trainers will be in this language.
* Please do the needed research before the event for all the things you are not related to that are in this document, mainly about the keywords that are listed as part of it.
